# Lung Cancer Detection in Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect lung cancer using a dataset containing various features related to lung cancer detection. The process involves data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, model training, and performance evaluation. The Jupyter Notebook includes all steps to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Building and training the machine learning model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using validation and test data.
- **Analysis**: Analyzing normal and anomalous (phenomenon) patterns in the dataset.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-detection.git
    cd lung-cancer-detection
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open the `lung_cancer_detection.ipynb` file and run all the cells sequentially.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project should be placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data is properly formatted and cleaned before running the notebook.

## Project Structure

```bash
lung-cancer-detection/
│
├── data/
│   └── lung_cancer_data.csv
│
├── lung_cancer_detection.ipynb
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `lung_cancer_detection.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all steps for the lung cancer detection process.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Analysis

The notebook includes a section for analyzing the results. It distinguishes between normal and anomalous (phenomenon) cases in the dataset, providing insights into the model's accuracy and potential areas for improvement.
